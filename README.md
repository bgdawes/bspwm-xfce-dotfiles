## The n00b's guide to bspwm...

If you are interested in tiling WM's but you're also an id10t (like me) the following guide below will walk you through setting up the best (imho) tiling WM, bspwm, to run alongside XFCE. This setup is nice for n00b id10t's because it grants you all of the great features of a tiling WM without having to sacrifice the conveniences of a DE (in this case, XFCE).
